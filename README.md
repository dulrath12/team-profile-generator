# team-profile-generator

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Team-Profile-Generator. This project allows you to answer different questions through command line input, then takes that user input and creates an html file that has the different memebers of the team on seperate cards, each with their own information. This program utilizes node.js and the npm packages: inquirer and jest. i started by setting up tests that would work for each of my different classes, and then after those were created, I then went on to create each of the different class objects. once those were done i had to create the questions and prompts for inquirer to gain the information that would be used to define the different characteristics of each class object. After that was done i then had to create functions to create each of the class cards, and then write the HTML outline out to accept those class cards. there were some things that were easier than others, but overall my interactions that include Javascript are getting easier and more fluid.
